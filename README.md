#  Superhero Name Generator using TensorFlow
In this guided project, we are going to create a neural network and train it on a small dataset of superhero names to learn to generate similar names. The dataset has over 9000 names of superheroes, supervillains and other fictional characters from a number of different comic books, TV shows and movies.

Welcome to the Superhero Name Generator project! 🦸‍♂️🚀

## Overview

In this guided project, we have created a powerful neural network and trained it on a diverse dataset of over 9000 superhero names, supervillains, and fictional characters from a variety of comic books, TV shows, and movies. Our goal is to generate exciting new superhero names using the knowledge we've gained in Natural Language Processing.

## Objectives

- Build a character-level language model using TensorFlow.
- Train the model to predict the next character in a sequence.
- Generate unique superhero names by providing seed input to the model.
- Create a custom tokenizer using TensorFlow.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/TLILIFIRAS/Create-a-Superhero-Name-Generator-with-TensorFlow.git
   cd Create-a-Superhero-Name-Generator-with-TensorFlow '''
   
2. **Generating Superhero Names:**
   Explore notebook.ipynb to generate superhero names with the trained model.
